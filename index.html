				<div class ="title">What is IoT ?</div>
			<p>The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the <b>billions of physical devices</b> around the world that 
			are now connected to the internet, <b>collecting and sharing data</b>. Thanks to cheap processors and 
			wireless networks, it's possible to turn anything, <b>from a pill to an aeroplane</b>, into part of the 
			IoT. This adds a level of <b>digital intelligence </b>devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling 
			them to communicate without a human being involved, and merging the digital and physical worlds.
			</p>

<p>Have you tried to find a comprehensive Internet of Things definition? Surprisingly, the Google answer is the following: 
“a proposed development of the Internet in which objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data”.

Wait. The Internet of Things in 2014/2015 is certainly not a “proposed development” anymore! The Internet of Things is REAL.

And Google should know this better than anyone else. In January 2014, <b>Google</b> acquired Nest, a company currently <b>selling more 
than 100,000</b> smart thermostats per month.</b>  As TechCrunch recently put it: “at this stage there’s no putting the [Internet of Things] genie back in the bottle”. 
There is plenty of more evidence: Wearable devices like the Jawbone Up have become mass market and <b>will be improved</b> like everything in the IOT world. The industrial conglomerate General Electric recently
announced that they are making <b>$1 billion</b> in IoT-related revenue in 2014. <br><br>

<div class ="title">History of IoT</div>
The idea of adding sensor and intelligence to basic objects was discussed throughout the 1980s and 1990s 
(and there are arguably some much earlier ancestors), but apart from some early projects  including an 
internet-connected vending machine  progress was slow simply because the technology wasn't ready.
Processors that were cheap and power-frugal enough to be all but disposable were required before it 
became cost-effective to connect up billions of devices.<br><br> 
<div class ="titleSmall">New technology</div>
The adoption of RFID tags  low-power chips 
that can communicate wirelessly  solved some of this issue, along with the increasing availability of
 broadband internet and cellular and wireless networking. The adoption of IPv6  which, among other 
 things, should provide enough IP addresses for every device the world (or indeed this galaxy) is 
 ever likely to need  was also a necessary step for the IoT to scale. Kevin
